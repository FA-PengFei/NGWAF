 Lu Ng (2010) uses dynamic conditional random fields perform sentence boundary sentence type prediction,0
 They achieved promising results English Chinese transcribed speech texts,0
" The work exploits local features, limited capturing long range dependencies punctuation prediction",0
" It natural incorporate global knowledge, syntactic information, improve punctuation prediction performance",0
 Roark et al,0

" The punctuation prediction works performed post-procedure step parsing, parse tree needs built advance",0
" As parsing stream words transcribed speech text exponentially complex, approaches feasible short input processing",0
" Unlike works, incorporate punctuation prediction parsing process left right input without length limitations",0
" Numerous dependency parsing algorithms proposed natural language processing community, including transition-based graph-based dependency parsing",0
" Compared graph-based parsing, transition-based parsing offer linear time complexity easily leverage non-local features models (Yamada Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al",0

" FAA: Air passengers use gadgets planes (but make cell phone calls) Airline passengers able use electronic devices gate-to-gate read , work , play games , watch movies listen music - talk cellphones - much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday Federal Aviation Administration ",0
 But passengers &apos;t expect changes happen immediately ,0
" How fast change implemented vary airline , FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said news conference ",0
 Airlines show FAA airplanes meet new guidelines &apos;ve updating flight crew training manuals rules stowing devices reflect new guidelines ,0
 The FAA said already received plans airlines expand use portable electronic devices planes ,0
 Delta JetBlue among airliners already submitted plans ,0
" &quot; Depending condition plan , could approve expanded use electronic devices soon , &quot; FAA said statement ",0
" Currently , passengers required turn smartphones , tablets devices plane &apos;s door closes ",0
" They &apos;re supposed restart planes reach 10,000 feet captain gives go-ahead ",0
 Passengers supposed turn devices plane descends land restart plane ground ,0
" Under new guidelines , airlines whose planes properly protected electronic interference may allow passengers use devices takeoffs , landings taxiing , FAA said ",0
 Most new airliners planes modified passengers use Wifi higher altitudes expected meet criteria ,0
" Laura Glading , president Association Professional Flight Attendants , welcomed changes ",0
" &quot; Once new policy safely implemented - &apos;re going work closely carrier - win-win , &quot; Glading said statement ",0
 We &apos;re frankly tired feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; comes issue ,0
" But connecting Internet surf , exchange emails , text download data still prohibited 10,000 feet , agency said ",0

 An industry advisory committee created FAA examine issue recommended last month government permit greater use personal electronic devices ,0
 Pressure building FAA recent years ease restrictions use ,0
 Critics Sen,0
" Claire McCaskill , D-Mo ",0
" , contend valid safety reason prohibitions ",0
 The restrictions also become increasingly difficult enforce use devices become ubiquitous ,0
 Some studies indicate many third passengers forget ignore directions turn devices ,0
" The FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use electronic devices 1966 response reports interference navigation communications equipment passengers began carrying FM radios , high-tech gadgets day ",0
" New airliners far reliant electrical systems previous generations aircraft , also designed approved FAA resistant electronic interference ",0
 Airlines offering Wi-Fi use cruising altitudes passengers several years ,0
 Planes modified Wi-Fi systems also resistant interference ,0
" The vast majority airliners qualify greater electronic device use new guidelines , Huerta said ",0
 Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions previous generations devices ,0
" E-readers , example , emit minimal transmissions turning page ",0
 But transmissions stronger devices downloading sending data ,0
 Among pressing relaxation restrictions passengers &apos; use devices Amazon,0
com,0
" In 2011 , company officials loaded airliner full Kindle e-readers flew around test problems found none ",0

" However , committee recommended FAA allow pilots order passengers shut devices instrument landings low visibility ",0

"<p>Neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple ""neuron"" <i>N </i> accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or ""fired""), cast a weighted ""vote"" for or against whether neuron <i>N </i> should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed ""<a href=""/wiki/Hebbian_learning"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Hebbian learning"">fire together, wire together </a>"") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms ""concepts"" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared<sup id=""cite_ref-232"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-232"">&#91;j&#93; </a> </sup> neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning ""leg"" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning ""foot"" that includes the sound for ""foot"". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.<sup id=""cite_ref-233"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-233"">&#91;k&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_4_234-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_4-234"">&#91;223&#93; </a> </sup> In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related <a href=""/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"" title=""Mergers and acquisitions"">M&amp;A </a> in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<sup id=""cite_ref-235"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-235"">&#91;224&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-236"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-236"">&#91;225&#93; </a> </sup>",0

"<dd>An <a href=""/wiki/Intelligent_agent"" title=""Intelligent agent"">intelligent agent </a> is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as <a href=""/wiki/Firm"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Firm"">firms </a>). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given ""goal function"". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works—some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic <a href=""/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"" title=""Artificial neural network"">artificial neural networks </a> and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as <a href=""/wiki/Decision_theory"" title=""Decision theory"">decision theory </a> and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<sup id=""cite_ref-Intelligent_agents_179-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-Intelligent_agents-179"">&#91;175&#93; </a> </sup> </dd> </dl>",0

""Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable.  Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate.  Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained.  AI failures have already led to tragedy.  Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars.  In the wrong situation, AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an instant.  When an enemy is trying to manipulate and hack an AI system, the risks are even greater.""  (p.&#160;140.) </li>",0

"<p>Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as <a href=""/wiki/Overfitting"" title=""Overfitting"">overfitting </a>. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_6,_Chapter_7_73-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_6,_Chapter_7-73"">&#91;71&#93; </a> </sup> Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by ""learning the wrong lesson"". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015286_74-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015286-74"">&#91;72&#93; </a> </sup> A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects.

" <p>Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like <a href=""/wiki/Machine_translation"" title=""Machine translation"">machine translation </a>, require that a machine read and write in both languages (<a href=""#Natural_language_processing"">NLP </a>), follow the author's argument (<a href=""#Deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving"">reason </a>), know what is being talked about (<a href=""#Knowledge_representation"">knowledge </a>), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent (<a href=""#Social_intelligence"">social intelligence </a>).

" </p><p>One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less automobile to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<sup id=""cite_ref-311"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-311"">&#91;300&#93; </a> </sup> Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.<sup id=""cite_ref-312"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-312"">&#91;301&#93; </a> </sup>",0

""Lexical affinity"" strategies use the occurrence of words such as ""accident"" to <a href=""/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"" title=""Sentiment analysis"">assess the sentiment </a> of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of ""narrative"" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<sup id=""cite_ref-123"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-123"">&#91;120&#93; </a> </sup>",0

"<p>In his book <i><a href=""/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"" title=""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"">Superintelligence </a> </i>, philosopher <a href=""/wiki/Nick_Bostrom"" title=""Nick Bostrom"">Nick Bostrom </a> provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit <a href=""/wiki/Instrumental_convergence"" title=""Instrumental convergence"">convergent </a> behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's—one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible—it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting ""electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins"" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<sup id=""cite_ref-368"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-368"">&#91;357&#93; </a> </sup>  In his book <i><a href=""/wiki/Human_Compatible"" title=""Human Compatible"">Human Compatible </a> </i>, AI researcher <a href=""/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell"" title=""Stuart J.

"<p>The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<sup id=""cite_ref-autogenerated1_397-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-autogenerated1-397"">&#91;386&#93; </a> </sup> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: ""Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.""<sup id=""cite_ref-autogenerated2_398-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-autogenerated2-398"">&#91;387&#93; </a> </sup> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

" </p><p>The ""imitation game"" (an interpretation of the 1950 <a href=""/wiki/Turing_test"" title=""Turing test"">Turing test </a> that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human) is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark.<sup id=""cite_ref-285"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-285"">&#91;274&#93; </a> </sup> A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (<a href=""/wiki/CAPTCHA"" title=""CAPTCHA"">CAPTCHA </a>). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEO&#39;BrienMarakas2011_286-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO&#39;BrienMarakas2011-286"">&#91;275&#93; </a> </sup>",0

" <p>The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): ""If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have <a href=""/wiki/Influenza"" title=""Influenza"">influenza </a>"". A second, more general, approach is <a href=""/wiki/Bayesian_inference"" title=""Bayesian inference"">Bayesian inference </a>: ""If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way"". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as <a href=""/wiki/Support_vector_machine"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Support vector machine"">SVM </a> and <a href=""/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""K-nearest neighbor algorithm"">nearest-neighbor </a>: ""After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza"". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the <a href=""/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"" title=""Artificial neural network"">artificial neural network </a> approach uses artificial ""<a href=""/wiki/Neurons"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Neurons"">neurons </a>"" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to ""reinforce"" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_2,_Chapter_4,_Chapter_6_71-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_2,_Chapter_4,_Chapter_6-71"">&#91;69&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-72"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-72"">&#91;70&#93; </a> </sup>",0

The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red.
